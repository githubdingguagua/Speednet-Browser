# This is SpeedNet
SpeedNet is a Chromium-based webbrowser, coded in C#. This is the updated version of my first SpeedNet Browser(Which runed on Awesomium and was coded in VB) This version is faster, more stable and overal better then the first one.

SpeedNet is under heavy development, so not every standard function is avalible yet(Like history, bookmarks, etc) But these functions are working at the moment:

- The standard browser functions(Navigation, Forward, Back, Refresh, Home)
- Tabs(Opening a new tab, closing one)
- Awesome UI(I want to have a simple UI so you can understand it easily, but it needs to look awesome ofcourse :D)
- Custom homepage

I'm working on new functions, like:
- History
- Bookmarks
- Chrome URL(So you can Google in your URL bar)
- Custom Search Engines(I need to have Chrome's URL bar first for this)
- Theme's

Have a question, or want to report an issue? Or even want to request something? Visit our website! speednet-browser.weebly.com
I recommend posting issue's here on GitHub, that makes it easier for me to respond.

I also have schoolwork, so it may take some time to respond on your questions/issues. I will update SpeedNet whenever I can.
